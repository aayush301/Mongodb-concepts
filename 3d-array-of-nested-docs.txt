Query an array of nested/embedded documents

Example of a document:
{
	orr: [
		{x:10},
		{x:20}
	]
}

Match all documents where orr contains atleast one document {x:10}
db.myCol1.find({
	orr: {x:10}
})

Match all documents where orr contains atleast one document that contains field x whose value<20
db.myCol1.find({
	"orr.x": {$lt:20}
})

Match all documents where orr has as its first element a document that contains field x>10
db.myCol1.find({
	"orr.0.x": {$gt:10}
})

Match all documents where orr has at least one document that contains x=10 and y=15
db.myCol1.find({
	orr: {$elemMatch: {x:10,y:15}}
})

Match all documents where orr has atleast one document that contains 10<x<20
db.myCol1.find({
	orr: {$elemMatch: {x: {$gt:10,$lt:20}}}
})

Match all documents where orr array has atleast one document that has x>10 and also orr has atleast 
one document(not necessarily the same document) that has x<20
(This means combination of documents in orr array must satisfy 10<x<20)
db.myCol1.find({
	"orr.x": {$gt:10,$lt:20}
})
